# Remeha Home integration for Home Assistant
This integration lets you control your Remeha Home thermostats from Home Assistant.

**Before using this integration, make sure you have set up your thermostat in the [Remeha Home](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bdrthermea.application.remeha) app.**
If you are unable to use the Remeha Home app for your thermostat, this integration will not work.

## Current features
- All climate zones are exposed as [climate](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/climate/) entities with:
    - The following modes:
        - Auto mode: the thermostat will follow the clock program.
        If the target temperature is changed, it will temporarily override the clock program until the next target temperature change in the schedule.
        - Heat mode: the thermostat will be set to manual mode and continuously hold the set temperature.
        - Off mode: the thermostat is disabled.
    - Three presets for the three clock programs available in the Remeha Home app.
    When a preset is selected, the integration will automatically switch the climate zone to auto mode to make sure the preset is applied.
- Each climate zone also exposes the following sensors/switches:
    - The next schedule setpoint
    - The time at which the next schedule setpoint gets activated
    - The current schedule setpoint
    - Switch to control fireplace mode
- Each hot water zone exposes the following sensors:
    - The water temperature
- Each appliance (CV-ketel) exposes the following sensors:
    - The water pressure
